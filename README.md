# Animal-Detection-Project

[GUI add_video_flags_kivy.py](Script_Files/add_video_flags_kivy.py)

This program builds what will be the GUI system that a user interacts with postprocessing of the set of videos. Right now the program will take an input video and a csv file containing where the [Flag](Script_Files/flag_still.py) file finds section of video where the animal was not detected for an extended period of time. 

In the future this program should allow a user to check the states and change it. Then allow the user to input data points by selecting points and possibility of performing polynomial interpolation to add even more data points to the set and create a continous set.
